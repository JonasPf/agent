# Changelog

What changed, newest first. One section per day of merged changes; the version
running is the commit the image was built from, which the app shows beside this
list under **More → version**.

This file ships with the app and is what that screen reads, so a change to
behaviour belongs here in the same commit that makes it — the same rule the
specs follow.

## 2026-09-11

- Compact a conversation in place: a compaction rewrites the session it happens
  in rather than seeding a successor, so a conversation keeps one identity for
  its whole life.
- `bash` says when it truncated its output instead of handing the model a body
  cut without notice.
- Every tool has a page of its own in the spec, saying what its manifest cannot.
- One sandbox mechanism: Landlock, with no second policy to keep in step.
- The interface warns when nothing is enforcing the sandbox, and the browser
  tools use whatever browser is actually installed.

## 2026-09-09

- A tool asks for the paths it needs, and the environment is hidden behind
  `/proc`.
- The sandbox grants `/sys` and `/var` as well: a runtime is more than its
  interpreter.
- Tools are confined with Landlock, which works in an unprivileged container
  where bubblewrap could not.
- The principle is written down: no surprises, in two halves. Changing the agent
  is composition, not a feature.

## 2026-09-08

- The deployment refuses to start without the credential in front of the agent,
  and routes from the compose file rather than a file placed by hand.
- A sandbox is claimed only after it has been proven to run.
- Nothing personal is published: fixtures are anonymised and the operator's
  notes are untracked and out of the build context.

## 2026-09-07

- The agent deploys as an image built by CI and proposes changes to itself
  through pull requests.
- A tool is given only the environment its manifest names.
- The interface is one responsive shell at every width.
- Finished jobs can be deleted in one action.
- The browser tools run inside the sandbox and no longer phone home while
  fetching a page.
- The agent is rebuilt around a tool subprocess contract, per-job pricing, and a
  task-driven workflow.

## 2026-09-01

- First working agent: sessions, jobs, memory, tools, and the web interface.
